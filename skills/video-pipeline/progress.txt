# Pipeline Unification — Progress Log

## Story 0: Audit & Isolate Research Agent (2026-02-15)

### Learnings

1. **Where was the research agent code actually found?**
   - No standalone research agent existed. Research logic was embedded in
     `brief_translator/supplementer.py` as targeted gap-filling.
   - The supplementer runs AFTER validation, filling specific gaps identified
     by the validator. It's not a deep research system.
   - The Elon/Machiavelli deep research referenced in the PRD was likely
     produced in an external session and manually added to Airtable.

2. **What was embedded vs standalone?**
   - Embedded: `supplementer.py` (targeted gap-filling within brief_translator)
   - Standalone: Nothing existed — `research_agent.py` was created fresh.
   - The supplementer remains in brief_translator for its gap-filling role.
     It's already properly modularized (separate file, imported by __init__.py).

3. **What interface pattern does the codebase use?**
   - Async functions with client injection:
     `async def func(anthropic_client, data, ...) -> dict`
   - All clients initialized in `pipeline.py`'s `VideoPipeline.__init__`
   - Results are structured dicts
   - CLI entry via `if __name__ == "__main__": asyncio.run(main())`

### Files Changed
- Created: `research_agent.py` (standalone deep research module)
- Created: `research_agent_audit.md` (audit documentation)
- Created: `progress.txt` (this file)
- Modified: `brief_translator/__init__.py` (updated docstring to reference research_agent)

## Story 1: Consolidate Airtable Entry Point (2026-02-15)

### Learnings

1. **Airtable table references found in:**
   - `clients/airtable_client.py` — main table IDs (IDEAS, SCRIPT, IMAGES)
   - `run_image_pipeline.py` — hardcoded table ID for Ideas
   - `bots/idea_bot.py` — calls `create_idea()`
   - `bots/trending_idea_bot.py` — calls `create_idea()` in two places
   - `pipeline.py` `--more-ideas` — inline code, didn't save to Airtable at all
   - `brief_translator/pipeline_writer.py` — uses `create_idea()` for graduation
   - `brief_translator/__init__.py` — uses `ideas_table` directly in fallback
   - n8n JSON bots (Idea Bot, Script Bot, Voice Bot) — hardcoded IDs, not touched

2. **Design decision: env var fallback**
   - `AIRTABLE_IDEA_CONCEPTS_TABLE_ID` env var configures the new table
   - Falls back to legacy IDEAS_TABLE_ID if not set (safe for existing deploys)
   - All Python entry points now route through `idea_concepts_table`

3. **Source field values:**
   - `url_analysis` — from `--idea` (IdeaBot)
   - `trending` — from `--trending` (TrendingIdeaBot)
   - `format_library` — from `--more-ideas` (now saves to Airtable!)
   - `research_agent` — reserved for Story 2

4. **Status flow unchanged:**
   - Idea Logged → (Ryan approves manually) → Ready For Scripting → ...
   - The "Approved" step is Ryan's manual intervention, not a code change

### Files Changed
- Modified: `clients/airtable_client.py` — added `idea_concepts_table`, `Source` field
- Modified: `bots/idea_bot.py` — passes `source="url_analysis"`
- Modified: `bots/trending_idea_bot.py` — passes `source="trending"` (2 places)
- Modified: `pipeline.py` — `--more-ideas` now saves to Airtable with `source="format_library"`
- Modified: `brief_translator/__init__.py` — fallback uses `idea_concepts_table`
- Modified: `brief_translator/pipeline_writer.py` — fallback uses `idea_concepts_table`
- Modified: `run_image_pipeline.py` — uses env var for table ID
- Modified: `.env.example` — documents new `AIRTABLE_IDEA_CONCEPTS_TABLE_ID`
