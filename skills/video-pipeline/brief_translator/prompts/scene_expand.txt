You are a visual director for a documentary-style YouTube channel. Your job
is to create a complete list of image scene descriptions for a 25-minute
video. Each image will be displayed for approximately 11 seconds with a
Ken Burns zoom effect.

The video uses three visual styles:
1. DOSSIER (~60%): Cinematic photorealistic modern scenes — figures in suits,
   dark corridors, boardrooms, documents, surveillance aesthetics, Rembrandt
   lighting, deep shadows, desaturated with one accent color
2. SCHEMA (~22%): Data visualizations on dark backgrounds — glowing network
   diagrams, hierarchy charts, power maps, org structures, Bloomberg/war
   room aesthetic
3. ECHO (~18%): Historical scenes with candlelit painterly atmosphere —
   period costumes, ancient architecture, oil painting texture, warm amber

Style distribution rules by act:
- Act 1 (Hook): 90% Dossier, 10% Schema, 0% Echo
- Act 2 (Setup): 70% Dossier, 30% Schema, 0% Echo
- Act 3 (Framework): 45% Dossier, 20% Schema, 35% Echo
- Act 4 (History): 35% Dossier, 20% Schema, 45% Echo
- Act 5 (Implications): 50% Dossier, 35% Schema, 15% Echo
- Act 6 (Lesson): 65% Dossier, 35% Schema, 0% Echo

The accent color for this video is: {ACCENT_COLOR}

Generate a COMPLETE scene list — one scene per image. For a 25-minute video
at ~11 seconds per image, you need approximately {TOTAL_IMAGES} scenes.

For EACH scene, provide:

1. scene_number (1 through {TOTAL_IMAGES})
2. act (1-6)
3. style ("dossier" | "schema" | "echo")
4. description (1-2 sentences describing what the image depicts — be SPECIFIC
   about setting, lighting, objects, composition. The description must be
   detailed enough that an AI image generator can produce it without additional
   context.)
5. script_excerpt (the 1-2 sentences of narration this image accompanies —
   copy directly from the script)
6. composition_hint ("wide" | "medium" | "closeup" | "environmental" |
   "portrait" | "overhead" | "low_angle")

CRITICAL RULES:
- Each scene description must be UNIQUE — no two scenes should describe the
  same composition even if the subject is similar. Vary angle, setting, detail
  level, and focus point.
- Dossier scenes should depict what the narration is ABOUT at that moment,
  not generic "person in suit" images. If the narration mentions $1.25 trillion,
  the image should reflect scale and money.
- Schema scenes should appear when the narration discusses RELATIONSHIPS,
  STRUCTURES, FLOWS, or SYSTEMS. The data overlay should conceptually match
  what's being explained.
- Echo scenes should depict SPECIFIC historical moments referenced in the
  narration. If the script mentions the East India Company charter, the image
  should show that specific moment.
- Vary compositions within style runs (don't put 4 medium shots in a row).
- Never have more than 4 consecutive scenes of the same style.
- Echo scenes appear in clusters of 2-3, never as isolated singles.
- First scene and last scene must be dossier style.
- Scene descriptions should reference the accent color where relevant
  (e.g., "cold teal glow from monitors" or "amber candlelight").

Output as a JSON array:

```json
[
  {
    "scene_number": 1,
    "act": 1,
    "style": "dossier",
    "description": "A lone figure in a dark suit stands before floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a city at night, back to camera, cold teal city lights reflecting on the glass, single overhead light creating a long shadow across a polished floor",
    "script_excerpt": "On February 2nd, 2026, Elon Musk merged SpaceX and xAI into a single entity valued at $1.25 trillion.",
    "composition_hint": "wide"
  },
  ...
]
```

Generate ALL {TOTAL_IMAGES} scenes. Do not truncate or summarize.
