I have a research brief for a YouTube video that has specific gaps I need
to fill. The topic is:

<topic>{HEADLINE}</topic>

<existing_research>
{EXISTING_RESEARCH}
</existing_research>

<gaps_to_fill>
{GAPS}
</gaps_to_fill>

Search for information that specifically fills these gaps. For each gap:
- Provide specific, sourced facts (not generalities)
- Focus on visually depictable details (settings, objects, scenes)
- Include dates, names, and concrete details that a scriptwriter can use

Do NOT repeat information already in the existing research. Only provide
NEW information that fills the identified gaps.
