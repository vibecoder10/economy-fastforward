# Deferred Verification

**Why this exists:** some checks need a real human at the keyboard (a mutating click, a
production dashboard nobody scripted access to) or hit an environment limit this session
couldn't work around. Nothing here is skipped-and-forgotten — each item has an exact
copy-pasteable recipe and an expected result. Tick items off as they're run; add new ones
whenever a session can't finish a live check itself.

## SFX render-path guard (commits a3453902, 9d83c621, branch `claude/exciting-swirles-4d8fba`) — 2026-07-24 night session

### 1. Local dev servers could not reach the production DB from this Mac — UI never actually verified live

**Blocker, not a code problem.** Backend started cleanly (`uvicorn main:app --port 8001`,
process up, `/api/health` responding), but every DB-backed request failed. Isolated with a raw
`asyncpg.connect()` test outside FastAPI — same `DATABASE_URL` that `se db` uses successfully
from the VPS returns `asyncpg.exceptions.InternalServerError: (ENOTFOUND) tenant/user
postgres.<project> not found` on every attempt from this local network (8/8 failures,
deterministic, not transient). See tasks/lessons.md 2026-07-24 (night) for the full
reproduction. Best guess: Supabase Network Restrictions (IP allowlist) scoped to the VPS's IP —
not confirmed, no Supabase dashboard access this session.

**What to run once this is fixed (or from a session that HAS prod DB access, e.g. on the VPS
itself):**

```bash
# 1. Confirm servers + DB reachable
curl -s localhost:8001/api/health | python3 -m json.tool | grep database   # expect "database": true

# 2. Confirm the new API fields, both videos
TOKEN=$(grep NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_TOKEN storyengine/frontend/.env.local | cut -d= -f2)
curl -s localhost:8001/api/videos/65a8021e-eafa-4cff-94dc-31982ae7b63d \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool | grep -i sound_effects
# Expected: "sound_effects_supported": false,
#           "sound_effects_unsupported_reason": "this video uses character-dialogue performance
#           rendering, which has no sound-effects track."

curl -s localhost:8001/api/videos/b4067bf5-9d6b-484e-8f7d-6fe7eb11416e \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool | grep -i sound_effects
# Expected: "sound_effects_supported": true,
#           "sound_effects_unsupported_reason": null

# 3. Browser walk (Claude Browser tools or Playwright), both video IDs' Sound tab:
#    /production/65a8021e-eafa-4cff-94dc-31982ae7b63d  -> Generate buttons DISABLED,
#      amber banner visible, text names the render path ("character-dialogue performance
#      rendering, which has no sound-effects track")
#    /production/b4067bf5-9d6b-484e-8f7d-6fe7eb11416e  -> normal Sound tab, buttons enabled,
#      NO banner (regression check — this is one of the ~44 legacy videos everything used to work
#      on)
#    Check browser console for errors on both.
```

**What IS verified (code-level, not live):** `storyengine/backend/status_map.py`'s
`_render_path_sfx_reason()` was read directly and manually evaluated against each video's real
DB row (pulled via `se db`, read-only):
- BLOCKED video `65a8021e-eafa-4cff-94dc-31982ae7b63d` ("El Mercado..."):
  `dialogue_mode='character_dialogue'`, `render_mode=NULL`, `dialogue_audio=NULL`,
  `custom_film_plan_id=NULL` → falls through to the `dialogue_mode == 'character_dialogue'`
  branch → `sound_effects_supported=False`, reason = "this video uses character-dialogue
  performance rendering, which has no sound-effects track."
- ALLOWED video `b4067bf5-9d6b-484e-8f7d-6fe7eb11416e` ("She Wanted To Bake A Cake..."): all
  four fields NULL → `_render_path_sfx_reason` returns `""` → `sound_effects_supported=True`,
  `sound_effects_unsupported_reason=None`.
- `storyengine/frontend/src/components/production/SoundTab.tsx` was read directly:
  `sfxSupported = video.sound_effects_supported !== false` (line 187) gates both Generate
  buttons' `disabled` prop (lines 405, 417) and the amber banner block (lines 385–396), which
  renders `video.sound_effects_unsupported_reason` verbatim. The wiring is present and
  self-consistent; it has NOT been watched render in a browser against real data.

This is a real gap: "the code reads correctly" is not the same as "a user sees the right thing."
Do not treat this as done until step 3 above has actually run.

### 2. Advance-button behavior on a blocked video — mutates prod, needs a human

Not attempted this session (mutation ban — see the session's safety rule, live prod DB, no user
awake to approve). What to check once someone can click things:

1. Open a video on a blocked render path (e.g. `65a8021e-eafa-4cff-94dc-31982ae7b63d`, or any
   live `dialogue_mode='character_dialogue'` video that hasn't reached the sound stage yet).
2. Advance it through the pipeline up to the sound design stage (`POST
   /api/pipeline/advance/{id}` or the UI's Advance button) and confirm it **skips the Sound
   stage automatically** rather than getting stuck — `pipeline_executor._enabled_stages()`
   should exclude `"sound"` for this video (per `status_map.stages_excluding_blocked_sound`),
   and `_run_next_step_status_map()` should skip-and-advance past
   `ready_for_sound_design`/`ready_for_sound_effects` without deadlocking.
3. Confirm via `se db "SELECT status FROM videos WHERE id='<id>'"` that status lands on the next
   real stage (thumbnail/render), not stuck at a sound status.
4. Also worth a click: try `POST /api/sound-prompts/{id}` and `POST /api/sound-effects/{id}`
   directly on the blocked video and confirm a 400 with the render-path reason in the body (this
   IS safe to test with a mutating-looking call since it's expected to be REFUSED, not to spend
   money — but skipped this session anyway per the blanket "no mutating clicks" rule; use
   judgment if re-attempting).
5. Sanity-check on an ALLOWED (legacy) video: confirm Sound generation still actually starts
   normally (a real, tiny paid call — get explicit cost approval first, this is real money).

### 3. Frontend `/pipeline` create-page checkbox (mentioned in commit a3453902's message)

The commit says the pipeline create page disables the "Sound design" stage checkbox when the
selected production style is static-documentary. Not walked live this session (same DB
blocker as above). Once the DB blocker is fixed: open `/pipeline` (create-video flow), pick the
static-documentary production style, and confirm the Sound design stage checkbox is disabled
with an explanatory tooltip/label, not just unchecked-but-clickable.

## D7-2 staleness hash (branch `d7-2-staleness-hash`) — apply migration 145 on next deploy window

**Built and tested in a worktree only — migration 145 was NOT applied to prod this session**
(no prod-migration writes allowed from a build-only chunk). NOTE: `backend/main.py`'s startup
hook auto-applies every not-yet-applied file under `backend/migrations/*.sql` (tracked in a
`_migrations` table) — so the normal `se deploy` for this branch (which restarts the backend
service) applies migration 145 automatically. There is no separate manual-SQL step; the
"deferred" part is verifying it actually landed, since a per-migration failure there only logs
a warning and does NOT fail the boot (`except Exception as e: logger.warning(...)` inside
`main.py::_run_pending_migrations`) — a broken migration could silently no-op forever unless
someone checks:

```bash
# 1. Lock the deploy window first (see storyengine/CLAUDE.md's VPS coordination rule), then
#    deploy this branch normally: push main, then
#    scripts/se.sh deploy <session-name> [--with-frontend]

# 2. Confirm the migration actually ran (not just that the file shipped) —
#    check the startup log line and the tracking table:
se logs backend 200 | grep "145_script_staleness_hash"
# Expect: "Migration applied: 145_script_staleness_hash.sql"
se db "SELECT filename FROM _migrations WHERE filename = '145_script_staleness_hash.sql'"
# Expect exactly 1 row. If it's missing, check `se logs backend` around boot time for
# "Migration 145_script_staleness_hash.sql failed: ..." and fix forward — do NOT hand-apply
# the raw SQL over `se db --write` as a workaround without first finding out WHY the
# auto-apply failed (silent partial-schema drift is worse than a slow fix).

# 3. Verify the columns exist
se db "SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'videos' \
  AND column_name IN ('characters_hash', 'environments_hash')"
# Expect 2 rows.

# 4. Verify the CHECK constraints were actually extended (not left as two constraints —
#    the DROP/ADD pattern in the migration is idempotent, but confirm the OLD constraint
#    name matched what migration 046/051 actually created)
se db "SELECT conname, pg_get_constraintdef(oid) FROM pg_constraint \
  WHERE conname IN ('video_characters_status_check', 'video_environments_status_check')"
# Expect both definitions to read: CHECK (status = ANY (ARRAY['draft'::text, 'approved'::text, 'stale'::text]))
# If either constraint is MISSING (name didn't match, e.g. renamed by some migration
# between 046/051 and now that this session's grep didn't find), migration 145's ADD
# CONSTRAINT line would have thrown and step 2's log/table check above would already have
# surfaced the failure — so a clean "applied" record already proves the name matched.

# 5. Sanity check no existing rows already sit outside (draft, approved, stale) — the
#    migration would have refused to apply if any did, but confirm anyway:
se db "SELECT status, count(*) FROM video_characters GROUP BY status"
se db "SELECT status, count(*) FROM video_environments GROUP BY status"

# 6. Smoke the round trip on ONE real video with an existing cast/environments:
#    a. Note its current video_characters/video_environments status values.
#    b. Edit one scene's text (PATCH .../scenes/{n}/text or the Director chat) enough
#       to change the wording.
#    c. se db "SELECT status FROM video_characters WHERE video_id='<id>'" -- expect 'stale'
#       (unless characters_hash was NULL because this video predates the migration and
#       nothing was ever regenerated since — that's the expected no-op case, not a bug).
#    d. Regenerate the cast (Characters tab -> Design characters) and confirm status
#       goes back to 'draft' (regeneration heals, per design).
```

**What IS verified (code-level + a full local test suite pass, not live prod):** all 4 writers
(`update_scene_text`, `rewrite_scene_text`, chat's `_apply_prompt_draft`, Drive pull-sync) plus
the 2 inline pipeline/Custom-Film script-write paths were exercised against a fake DB in
`storyengine/backend/tests/functional/test_d7_2_staleness_hash.py` (12 tests, all passing) —
including a stash-proof (neutering `_flag_stale_cast_and_environments` to a no-op produces 6
real `AssertionError` failures, reverted after confirming) and a second stash-proof substituting
a `DELETE` for the `UPDATE video_characters SET status='stale'` write (caught by the `_no_deletes`
helper). The full backend suite (`./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q`) passes 3848/3877 both
with and without this branch's changes — the same 29 pre-existing failures (`test_custom_film_
remotion.py`, `test_youtube_oauth_diagnostics.py`), byte-identical sorted FAILED sets stashed vs
applied. What is NOT verified: the migration actually running against the real Supabase
Postgres instance, and a real browser/UI walk of a script edit flagging a real video's cast card
"stale" (there is no UI for this yet — D7-4, per the chunk spec, is UI-out-of-scope for D7-2).

## D8-3b arbiter findings persistence (branch `d8-3b-findings-persist`) — apply migration 146 BEFORE D8-2's live run

**Built and tested in a worktree only — migration 146 was NOT applied to prod this session**
(no prod-migration writes allowed from a build-only chunk). Same auto-apply mechanism as
migration 145 above (`backend/main.py`'s startup hook applies every not-yet-applied file under
`backend/migrations/*.sql`, tracked in `_migrations`, a per-file failure only logs a warning and
does not fail boot) — so the normal `se deploy` for this branch applies migration 146
automatically, but landing it must happen BEFORE D8-2's first live arbiter run (parked on Ryan's
deploy window) or that run's per-instance findings are lost the same way D8-3 found them lost
before this chunk.

```bash
# 1. Lock the deploy window first (storyengine/CLAUDE.md's VPS coordination rule), then deploy
#    this branch normally: push main, then scripts/se.sh deploy <session-name> [--with-frontend]
#    — BEFORE letting D8-2's live run fire.

# 2. Confirm the migration actually ran:
se logs backend 200 | grep "146_arbiter_findings"
# Expect: "Migration applied: 146_arbiter_findings.sql"
se db "SELECT filename FROM _migrations WHERE filename = '146_arbiter_findings.sql'"
# Expect exactly 1 row. If missing, check `se logs backend` around boot time for
# "Migration 146_arbiter_findings.sql failed: ..." and fix forward — never hand-apply the raw
# SQL over `se db --write` without first finding out WHY the auto-apply failed.

# 3. Verify the table + both indexes exist:
se db "SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'arbiter_findings' ORDER BY ordinal_position"
# Expect all 17 columns: id, tenant_id, video_id, scene, station, reference, label, image_url,
# classification, failure_class, rule_id, fingerprint_key, rubric_level,
# decisive_prompt_fragment, description, new_vs_previous, cost, created_at (18 incl. id).
se db "SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'arbiter_findings'"
# Expect arbiter_findings_pkey, arbiter_findings_tenant_created_idx, arbiter_findings_video_scene_idx.

# 4. AFTER D8-2's first live run fires (the actual point of this chunk): confirm rows exist and
#    match what the board station judged:
se db "SELECT station, reference, classification, failure_class, cost, created_at \
  FROM arbiter_findings ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20"
# Expect one row per panel judged in that run, station='board' (judge_scene_batch/judge_frame
# are not wired to any hook yet, only judge_board_sheet is), classification one of
# MODEL_DEFECT/AUTHORING_DEFECT/TASTE_QUESTION/OK.

# 5. Confirm GET /api/review/findings returns those same rows under `instances`:
TOKEN=$(grep NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_TOKEN storyengine/frontend/.env.local | cut -d= -f2)
curl -s https://<prod-api-host>/api/review/findings -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A3 '"instances"' | head -20
# Expect a non-empty `instances` array shaped per backend/models.py's ArbiterFindingInstance.

# 6. Walk the Findings tab in the browser (webapp-testing / se-smoke skill): /review -> Findings
#    tab -> confirm a "Judged frames & panels" section renders below the existing fingerprint/
#    spend sections, with a classification badge, station/reference, description, and (when the
#    judge call attached one) an image thumbnail per row.
```

**What IS verified (code-level + a full local test suite pass, not live prod):**
`storyengine/backend/tests/functional/test_d8_3b_findings_persist.py` (14 tests) covers
`arbiter_findings.record_finding_instances`'s field-mapping (board `panel`->`reference`/`label`
vs frame `image_index`->`reference`/`shot_type`->`label`, per-finding cost winning over call-level
cost, skipped/unrecognized-classification entries never persisted, one bad row never blocking the
rest of a batch) and `frame_arbiter_hook.run_after_storyboard_sheet`'s wiring (a write fires with
the right tenant/video/scene/station/cost/image_url after BOTH the first judgment and a
successful post-repair rejudge; a raised exception from `write_findings_fn` never propagates out
of the hook and never skips a later sheet's own judge/repair pass). `test_d8_3_review_findings.py`
was extended for the endpoint's third query (per-instance rows, scoped to tenant_id + the
`_FINDING_INSTANCES_LIMIT` cap). Three real stash-proofs were run (patch-file technique, never
`git stash`, per tasks/lessons.md's fleet rule): (a) neutering `_finding_cost` to always return
`call_cost` broke the frame-station cost assertion with a real `AssertionError` (999.0 == 0.019
mismatch); (b) removing the `try/except` around the hook's write call let a simulated
`RuntimeError` propagate all the way out of `run_after_storyboard_sheet`, failing the test with
that real exception; (c) neutering `get_findings` to always return `instances=[]` broke the
endpoint shape test with a real `AssertionError` (`0 == 1`) — all three reverted immediately
after confirming. The full backend suite (`./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q`, main checkout's
venv binary against worktree code) passes 3867/3896 stashed-technique baseline vs applied — the
same pre-existing 29 failures (`test_custom_film_remotion.py`, `test_youtube_oauth_diagnostics.py`),
sorted FAILED sets byte-identical (diffed, empty output, exit 0). Frontend: `npx tsc --noEmit`
clean, `npm run build` passes (34/34 static pages) once `frontend/node_modules` and
`frontend/.env.local` are present in the worktree — neither is git-tracked, so a fresh worktree
needs `npm install` (or a symlink to an existing checkout's `node_modules`) and a copy of
`.env.local` (or `scripts/se.sh devtoken`) before running the frontend checks; this was done
locally for verification and removed afterward, not committed. What is NOT verified: the
migration actually running against the real Supabase Postgres instance, any real per-instance row
from a live judge call (D8-2's first live run hasn't happened yet — that is the entire point this
chunk exists to protect), and a real browser walk of the Findings tab's new "Judged frames &
panels" section against live data.

## D9-1 shot-purpose harvest (branch `d9-1-shot-purpose`) — apply migration 147 on next deploy window; confirm the PURPOSE tag actually shows up in a real plan

**Built and tested in a worktree only — migration 147 was NOT applied to prod this session**
(no prod-migration writes allowed from a build-only chunk). Same auto-apply mechanism as every
prior migration (`main.py`'s startup hook, tracked in `_migrations`, warn-not-fail on a per-file
error) — the "deferred" part is confirming it actually landed AND that a real planner call
actually emits the new PURPOSE row (a prompt-only change; no test in this chunk calls the real
Claude API):

```bash
# 1. Lock the deploy window first (see storyengine/CLAUDE.md's VPS coordination rule), then
#    deploy this branch normally: push main, then
#    scripts/se.sh deploy <session-name> [--with-frontend]

# 2. Confirm the migration actually ran
se logs backend 200 | grep "147_shot_purpose"
# Expect: "Migration applied: 147_shot_purpose.sql"
se db "SELECT filename FROM _migrations WHERE filename = '147_shot_purpose.sql'"
# Expect exactly 1 row.

# 3. Verify the columns exist
se db "SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'assets' \
  AND column_name IN ('purpose_kind', 'shot_purpose')"
# Expect 2 rows.

# 4. Plan ONE real scene's coverage (sheet-preview planning, no spend — Scenes page ->
#    "plan the shots" / plan_only path) and read the raw directive.txt/coverage_directive
#    back out:
se db "SELECT coverage_directive FROM scripts WHERE video_id='<id>' AND scene=<n>"
# Confirm the planner ACTUALLY wrote "PURPOSE: <kind> | <text>" rows under real MASTER/ANGLE
# lines — this chunk only proves the PARSER handles the tag correctly if the LLM writes it;
# it does not prove Claude reliably follows a brand-new prompt rule on its first live call.
# If PURPOSE rows are sparse/absent on a real plan, check_shot_purpose_present's WARN log line
# ("shot-purpose check (D9-1): ... carries no PURPOSE: line") should be showing up in
# `se logs backend` around that plan's generation — confirms the WARN gate itself is live,
# even if the prompt compliance needs a follow-up nudge.

# 5. Draw that same scene's real pictures (spend gate — confirm cost with Ryan first) and
#    confirm the columns actually populate:
se db "SELECT scene, image_index, purpose_kind, shot_purpose FROM assets \
  WHERE video_id='<id>' AND scene=<n> AND generation_method='coverage' ORDER BY image_index"
# Expect purpose_kind/shot_purpose populated (non-NULL) for shots whose PURPOSE row survived
# step 4's plan, NULL for any shot the planner didn't tag (floor-added REACTION/INSERT shots,
# or a plain miss) — NULL here is not itself a bug, see step 4.
```

**What IS verified (code-level + full local test suite passes, not live prod):**
`skills/video-pipeline/tests/test_d9_1_shot_purpose.py` (11 tests) covers `parse_coverage`'s
extraction of the per-shot `PURPOSE: <kind> | <text>` row (master and angle independently, bold
markdown tolerated, kind lowercased), the row never surviving into the stored `description` (the
whole reason it lives on its own line — rule 23/L27, INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT CAPTIONS), BACKWARD
COMPATIBILITY against `SAMPLE` — the exact pre-existing fixture `test_coverage.py` already used
before this chunk — parsing byte-identical on `shot_type`/`description` with purpose fields simply
`None`, the new `check_shot_purpose_present` WARN gate (silent when every shot is tagged, flags
exactly the untagged ones, flags all 5 shots on the legacy `SAMPLE` fixture with no crash),
`generate_coverage_frames` threading `purpose_kind`/`shot_purpose` onto its frame dicts AND proof
the purpose text never reaches the actual image-generation prompt string (a planted marker string
in `shot_purpose` is asserted absent from the prompt `_gen_ref` receives), `enforce_setup_variety`'s
content-swap carrying purpose fields along with `shot_type`/`description` (so a swap never leaves
a shot's stated purpose describing a framing that moved elsewhere), and `plan_moments_deterministic`
(the ONE shared parse->budget->floors->variety pipeline both the sheet-preview planning path and
the real-pictures path call) preserving purpose fields end to end including a floor-added filler
shot correctly landing with none. `storyengine/backend/tests/functional/
test_d9_1_shot_purpose_stamp.py` (3 tests) proves `store_scene`'s INSERT actually stamps
`purpose_kind`/`shot_purpose` from a frame dict's fields (present, NULL-default, and independently
per-shot within one moment) — the sheet-preview planning path never inserts an asset row at all
("Storyboard SHEETS are a preview, not an asset row" is coverage_to_app.py's own comment, confirmed
by reading it — nothing to stamp there), so `store_scene` is the one real stamping site and both
paths feed it identical parsed fields via the shared `plan_moments_deterministic`. Real stash-proof
(patch-file technique, never `git stash`, per tasks/lessons.md's fleet rule): `git diff --cached`
of the full chunk saved to a patch, reverse-applied cleanly (`git apply -R`, working tree confirmed
clean after), pipeline suite (`test_board_laws.py` + `test_d6_2_repair_stamps.py` + `test_coverage.py`)
still 150/150 passing reverted (new D9-1 test files gone with the revert, no orphaned failures),
full backend suite (`./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q`, main checkout's venv binary against
worktree code) 29 failed / 3867 passed reverted vs 29 failed / 3882 passed applied (the +15 are
this chunk's own new tests) — sorted FAILED sets byte-identical (diffed, empty output), then the
patch forward-applied cleanly to restore the chunk. `schema.sql`'s `assets` table updated with the
2 new columns (with a note: `assets.shot_location`/`assets.group_arrangement` from migration 143
were ALREADY missing from `schema.sql` before this chunk touched it — a pre-existing drift, not
something this chunk introduced or fixed; flagged separately, not folded into this migration).
What is NOT verified: the migration actually running against the real Supabase Postgres instance,
whether Claude reliably follows the new PURPOSE-row prompt rule on a real, unseen scene (prompt
compliance is never provable from a parser unit test — that's what step 4 above is for), and a
real `assets.purpose_kind`/`shot_purpose` value landing from an actual paid coverage-picture draw.
