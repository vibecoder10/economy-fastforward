# Deferred Verification

**Why this exists:** some checks need a real human at the keyboard (a mutating click, a
production dashboard nobody scripted access to) or hit an environment limit this session
couldn't work around. Nothing here is skipped-and-forgotten — each item has an exact
copy-pasteable recipe and an expected result. Tick items off as they're run; add new ones
whenever a session can't finish a live check itself.

## SFX render-path guard (commits a3453902, 9d83c621, branch `claude/exciting-swirles-4d8fba`) — 2026-07-24 night session

### 1. Local dev servers could not reach the production DB from this Mac — UI never actually verified live

**Blocker, not a code problem.** Backend started cleanly (`uvicorn main:app --port 8001`,
process up, `/api/health` responding), but every DB-backed request failed. Isolated with a raw
`asyncpg.connect()` test outside FastAPI — same `DATABASE_URL` that `se db` uses successfully
from the VPS returns `asyncpg.exceptions.InternalServerError: (ENOTFOUND) tenant/user
postgres.<project> not found` on every attempt from this local network (8/8 failures,
deterministic, not transient). See tasks/lessons.md 2026-07-24 (night) for the full
reproduction. Best guess: Supabase Network Restrictions (IP allowlist) scoped to the VPS's IP —
not confirmed, no Supabase dashboard access this session.

**What to run once this is fixed (or from a session that HAS prod DB access, e.g. on the VPS
itself):**

```bash
# 1. Confirm servers + DB reachable
curl -s localhost:8001/api/health | python3 -m json.tool | grep database   # expect "database": true

# 2. Confirm the new API fields, both videos
TOKEN=$(grep NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_TOKEN storyengine/frontend/.env.local | cut -d= -f2)
curl -s localhost:8001/api/videos/65a8021e-eafa-4cff-94dc-31982ae7b63d \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool | grep -i sound_effects
# Expected: "sound_effects_supported": false,
#           "sound_effects_unsupported_reason": "this video uses character-dialogue performance
#           rendering, which has no sound-effects track."

curl -s localhost:8001/api/videos/b4067bf5-9d6b-484e-8f7d-6fe7eb11416e \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool | grep -i sound_effects
# Expected: "sound_effects_supported": true,
#           "sound_effects_unsupported_reason": null

# 3. Browser walk (Claude Browser tools or Playwright), both video IDs' Sound tab:
#    /production/65a8021e-eafa-4cff-94dc-31982ae7b63d  -> Generate buttons DISABLED,
#      amber banner visible, text names the render path ("character-dialogue performance
#      rendering, which has no sound-effects track")
#    /production/b4067bf5-9d6b-484e-8f7d-6fe7eb11416e  -> normal Sound tab, buttons enabled,
#      NO banner (regression check — this is one of the ~44 legacy videos everything used to work
#      on)
#    Check browser console for errors on both.
```

**What IS verified (code-level, not live):** `storyengine/backend/status_map.py`'s
`_render_path_sfx_reason()` was read directly and manually evaluated against each video's real
DB row (pulled via `se db`, read-only):
- BLOCKED video `65a8021e-eafa-4cff-94dc-31982ae7b63d` ("El Mercado..."):
  `dialogue_mode='character_dialogue'`, `render_mode=NULL`, `dialogue_audio=NULL`,
  `custom_film_plan_id=NULL` → falls through to the `dialogue_mode == 'character_dialogue'`
  branch → `sound_effects_supported=False`, reason = "this video uses character-dialogue
  performance rendering, which has no sound-effects track."
- ALLOWED video `b4067bf5-9d6b-484e-8f7d-6fe7eb11416e` ("She Wanted To Bake A Cake..."): all
  four fields NULL → `_render_path_sfx_reason` returns `""` → `sound_effects_supported=True`,
  `sound_effects_unsupported_reason=None`.
- `storyengine/frontend/src/components/production/SoundTab.tsx` was read directly:
  `sfxSupported = video.sound_effects_supported !== false` (line 187) gates both Generate
  buttons' `disabled` prop (lines 405, 417) and the amber banner block (lines 385–396), which
  renders `video.sound_effects_unsupported_reason` verbatim. The wiring is present and
  self-consistent; it has NOT been watched render in a browser against real data.

This is a real gap: "the code reads correctly" is not the same as "a user sees the right thing."
Do not treat this as done until step 3 above has actually run.

### 2. Advance-button behavior on a blocked video — mutates prod, needs a human

Not attempted this session (mutation ban — see the session's safety rule, live prod DB, no user
awake to approve). What to check once someone can click things:

1. Open a video on a blocked render path (e.g. `65a8021e-eafa-4cff-94dc-31982ae7b63d`, or any
   live `dialogue_mode='character_dialogue'` video that hasn't reached the sound stage yet).
2. Advance it through the pipeline up to the sound design stage (`POST
   /api/pipeline/advance/{id}` or the UI's Advance button) and confirm it **skips the Sound
   stage automatically** rather than getting stuck — `pipeline_executor._enabled_stages()`
   should exclude `"sound"` for this video (per `status_map.stages_excluding_blocked_sound`),
   and `_run_next_step_status_map()` should skip-and-advance past
   `ready_for_sound_design`/`ready_for_sound_effects` without deadlocking.
3. Confirm via `se db "SELECT status FROM videos WHERE id='<id>'"` that status lands on the next
   real stage (thumbnail/render), not stuck at a sound status.
4. Also worth a click: try `POST /api/sound-prompts/{id}` and `POST /api/sound-effects/{id}`
   directly on the blocked video and confirm a 400 with the render-path reason in the body (this
   IS safe to test with a mutating-looking call since it's expected to be REFUSED, not to spend
   money — but skipped this session anyway per the blanket "no mutating clicks" rule; use
   judgment if re-attempting).
5. Sanity-check on an ALLOWED (legacy) video: confirm Sound generation still actually starts
   normally (a real, tiny paid call — get explicit cost approval first, this is real money).

### 3. Frontend `/pipeline` create-page checkbox (mentioned in commit a3453902's message)

The commit says the pipeline create page disables the "Sound design" stage checkbox when the
selected production style is static-documentary. Not walked live this session (same DB
blocker as above). Once the DB blocker is fixed: open `/pipeline` (create-video flow), pick the
static-documentary production style, and confirm the Sound design stage checkbox is disabled
with an explanatory tooltip/label, not just unchecked-but-clickable.
