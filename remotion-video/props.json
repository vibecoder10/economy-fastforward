But here's what nobody talks about. It took the typical family eleven years to recover. Eleven years of their life, gone. Meanwhile, the top ten percent doubled their wealth in just thirty-six months.\n\nThis pattern repeats with mathematical precision. After the dot-com crash, same story. After Black Monday, identical outcome. Every single economic reset in modern history has functioned as a wealth transfer machine, pulling money from those who don't understand what's happening and funneling it directly to those who do.\n\nNow here's the part that should keep you up at night. The window to position yourself on the right side of this transfer is not just closing. It's nearly shut.\n\nBy twenty twenty-seven, the decisions you make in the next eighteen months will determine whether you spend the next decade building wealth or desperately trying to recover what you lost.

Not because he was smarter, but because he recognized a pattern. When everyone becomes an expert, the experts become exit liquidity.\n\nThe Rockefellers did something even more counterintuitive. They bought. While banks collapsed and properties sold for pennies, they accumulated assets that would multiply a hundredfold over the next decade.\n\nBut here's what history books miss.
